PRIOR HISTORY
_______________
NOT APPROVED BY CDM DUE TO THE FOLLOWING:
The DOE (ERMCVS) failed to substantiate: (i) the real and continuing actions undertaken to secure the CDM status for the project activity in accordance with validation and verification standard (VVS), version 2, paragraph 108 (b); and (ii) the monitoring of quantity of net electricity supplied to the grid (EGfacility,y) in accordance with the monitoring methodology of AMS I.D version 17, paragraph 24.

CDM DOE clarification:
Although the CDM consultancy contract was not finally signed until 2009, this is explained by the timeline of implementation of the project, which suffered severe and unforeseen delays. Despite this, the senior management level of the PP were actively engaged in pursuing the CDM registration of the project, and the decision to delay signing of a CDM consulting contract was an active decision and was not due to any deprioritisation of CDM registration efforts or lack of willingness to pursue CDM registration. The actions taken do demonstrate real commitment by the most senior level of the PP, and hence are considered real actions. 

PP and DOE actions:
PDD section B.7.3 was revised to include further explanation of the apportioning procedure. Monitoring section of FVR is was revised to include the validation steps followed to assess the compliance of description of monitoring plan documented in the PDD.   As explained above, ERM CVS has validated, based on the VVS version 02.0, that this project meets the monitoring requirements of AMS 1.D and that the relevant CDM requirements for demonstrating ‘real actions’ have been demonstrated.
